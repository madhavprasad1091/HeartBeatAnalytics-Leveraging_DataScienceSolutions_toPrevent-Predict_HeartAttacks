# HeartBeatAnalytics-Leveraging_DataScienceSolutions_toPrevent-Predict_HeartAttacks

# Problem statement:
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The data below has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. 

# Task to be performed:

Task-1:	Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings on the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.

Task-2: Based on these findings, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy

Task-3: Prepare a report about the data explaining the distribution of the disease and the related factors
  
Task-4:	Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data and explore the measures of central tendencies and spread of the data
	
Task-5:	Identify the data variables which are categorical and describe and explore these variables using the appropriate tools, such as count plot
	 
Task-6:	Study the occurrence of CVD across the Age category
	
Task-7:	Study the composition of all patients with respect to the Sex category
	
Task-8:	Study if one can detect heart attacks based on anomalies in the resting blood pressure (trestbps) of a patient
	
Task-9:	 Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and a target variable

Task-10:  Build a baseline model to predict the risk of a heart attack using a logistic regression and random forest and explore the results while using correlation analysis and logistic regression (leveraging standard error and p-values from statsmodels) for feature selection
